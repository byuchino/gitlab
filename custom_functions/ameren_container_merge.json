This function will copy all artifacts, automation, notes and commands over from every container within the container_list into the target_container.  The target_container will be upgraded to a case.  The notes will be copied over with references to the child containers from where they came.  A note will be left in the child containers with a link to the target container.  The child containers will be marked as evidence within the target container.  Any notes left as a consequence of the merge process will be skipped in subsequent merges.",
